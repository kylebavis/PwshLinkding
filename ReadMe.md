# PwshLinkding PowerShell Module

## 💬 Description

[Linkding](https://linkding.link/) is a tool for managing bookmarks and archiving webpages. This is a PowerShell module to interact with the Linkding API.

## ❓ Why this exists

The Linkding web UI has limited options for search. I needed a way to dig around in my bookmarks to clean up some bad data I imported.
